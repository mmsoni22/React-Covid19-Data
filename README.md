# Get Covid-19 data using API 

I have created a project using React library where I fetch the data from https://covid19-api.com/. I was pretty confident to make a project using class base component but less confident in using hooks so here I found a Covoid-19 API then read the documentation and studied JSON data. After that, it was time to decide the method and I go for using hooks- "useEffect" and "useState".
